## Problem Statement 

Job seekers face multiple challenges during the application process: 

• Manually searching across different job portals is time-consuming. 

• Tailoring resumes and cover letters for each role is tedious. 

• Applicants often don’t know how well they match a job before applying. 

JobHuntCopilot addresses these issues by offering an AI-powered platform that combines job aggregation, resume-job fit scoring, tailored cover letter generation, and an application tracker in one solution.
